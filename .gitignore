# --- ROS Specific Generated Files ---
# Autogenerated files by ROS (e.g., header files, message types)
# These are typically in install/ or build/, but adding specific patterns here is safer
# if they somehow end up elsewhere.
# For C++:
# *.h # (Be careful with this, if you manually create header files)
# For Python:
# No common auto-generated files that aren't already covered by build/install/

# --- Temporary Files and Logs ---
*.log
*.tmp
*~
.#*

# --- Environment Configuration ---
# ROS environment setup scripts if you've created custom ones outside of install/
# setup.bash
# setup.zsh
# setup.ps1
# local_setup.bash
# local_setup.zsh
# local_setup.ps1

# --- Operating System Specific ---
# macOS
.DS_Store

# Windows
Thumbs.db

# --- Backup Files ---
*.bak

# --- Dependencies & Vendor Libraries (if not managed by git) ---
# If you manually copied third-party libraries and don't want to track them
# For ROS, dependencies are usually managed by colcon/rosdep, so no need to explicitly ignore those.
